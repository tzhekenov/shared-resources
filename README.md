# Realization of AI - Shared resources repository.

Hey there, dear students 👋

This repository contains shared resources useful for you during your realization of the course 🛠!

The shared resources you can find here are:

  during the section of the course related to Cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). It deploys 
  various resources among which are an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, and an ECR repository. Refer to the dedicated README in the `docs` folder for more information.
  
* Various README's and How-To's: You will find in the `docs` folder various instruction files that 
  will help you get started at various points of the course.

* Interactive Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder that you can use as reference and helpers 
  while implementing your project.
